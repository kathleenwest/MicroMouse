# MicroMouse

Senior Design Project - Electrical Engineering - Valparaiso University (2003)

This final report summarizes the final progress of the MicroMouse senior project team and clarifies the ultimate design solution by first discussing the problem definition, posed solution, and benefits of implementation. Secondly the as built specifications address the mechanical and electrical technical specifications which include drawings, diagrams, and schematics that illustrate the final constructed MicroMouse. Each design requirement is then addressed and verified by test results. Lastly, the final report includes a concluding cost analysis of the project. Overall, the MicroMouse meet most of the system design requirements and was under budget with a cost of only $394.60.

Code

Interactive C and Features  

Interactive C Version 3.2, by Newton Research Labs, is a windows based program developed for the compilation environment for many Motorola 6811 based robots and embedded systems. This program allows for easy user interaction.  Users can type in expressions and have them compiled on the fly and run immediately, rather than waiting for lengthy compile and download cycles. Most importantly, it is fully compatible with the HandyBoard.   

 Interactive C v 3.2 was chosen for this project because it is a windows based program with a built-in editor, designed for easy editing and compiling.  This feature eliminates the need to manually compile and edit using the freeware. Interactive C also has the ability to use predefined macros at the command line, which allow us to easily debug our MicroMouse software. Multidimensional arrays, (which are a necessity for describing the MicroMouse) are featured in this version. Also, it has an automatic interface to the HandyBoard for downloading the compiled code to the MicroMouse.
